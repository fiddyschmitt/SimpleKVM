# Simple KVM
Control multiple computers using one set of Keyboard, Mouse and Monitor.

Full KVMs are quite expensive, particularly ones which supports high resolution / high framerate.

Using this program and a cheap USB Switch (see below), you can achieve the same without spending hundreds of dollars.

## How does it work?
The program detects when USB devices connect or disconnect, or when hotkeys are pressed. It then tells the monitor to change its input source using a DDC/CI command, which many monitors support.

## Does it support multiple monitors?

Yes
